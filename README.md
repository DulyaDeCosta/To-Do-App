# üåê Node.js CRUD Web App

Welcome to the **Node.js CRUD Web App**! This powerful application allows you to perform the four essential CRUD operations with MongoDB: Create, Read, Update, and Delete records.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run your Node.js web app:

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Required Dependencies**

   Open your terminal and run the following command to install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   npm install --save express mongoose ejs dotenv
   ```

(Note : If you encounter any issues with the installation, you might need to clear your npm cache. 
Run these commands sequentially to resolve the problem:
  ```bash
  npm cache clean --force
  npm cache clean
  npm install --cache /tmp/empty-cache
  ```

  **Install Nodemon**
  Nodemon is a utility that monitors for changes in your source code and automatically restarts the server. 
  Install it using:
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev nodemon
  ```
2.**Set Up MongoDB**

Make sure your MongoDB setup is complete. Configure your database connection as required.

### Running the Application

In your terminal, enter the following command to start your web server:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

**Access the Application**
  Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to see the app in action.
